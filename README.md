# My portfolio built with astro

Special thanks to the designer who developed this theme, Jeanine White. 

## Why I used a pre-made theme?

Im no UI/UX designer, Im a developer. And while I was having fun learning design, I was spending too much time on that instead of writing content for the site. So I made the tough decision to go with this theme, which was already exactly the type of design i was striving for, so I can spend more time writing content and working on projects. 

While this is a premade theme, I did put my own touch on it. I changed the fonts to those which I picked for my previous portfolio, and I changed some of the site's wording to better reflect my own experience level and skills.

## Why Astro?

Astro is a really awesome tool. It's the perfect combination of my skills with JavaScript/TypeScript, React, HTML, and CSS. And it allows for a faster, lighter bundle to be shipped to the browser. Look at my portfolio for an in depth article about my portfolio where ill delve deeper into why i chose Astro over something like NextJS.
